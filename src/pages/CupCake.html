                <p><b>How to Mack Cup Cack</b></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1
                        Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter two 9-inch round cake pans or two 12-by-17-inch rimmed baking sheets. Line bottoms with parchment; butter parchment and flour pans, tapping out excess flour. Whisk together egg yolks and 1 cup granulated sugar in a bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water until sugar has dissolved and mixture is warm, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until pale and thick enough to form a ribbon that dissolves onto itself, 3 to 5 minutes. Beat in vanilla and salt; transfer to a large bowl.
                    </li>
                    <li>Step 2
                        Beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar and beat on medium-high speed until stiff, glossy peaks form, about 2 minutes. Fold one third of egg whites into yolks, then gently fold in remaining whites. Sift flour over top and gently start to fold in. When nearly all is folded in, pour melted butter down side of bowl and fold just until incorporated and smooth.</li>
                    <li>Step 3
                        Divide batter among pans and bake until a toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean, about 25 minutes for rounds, or 15 minutes for sheets, rotating and switching racks halfway through. If baking in round pans, immediately invert cake and remove parchment, then reinvert and cool right side up. If using baking sheets and making a rolled cake, immediately invert cake onto a kitchen towel dusted with confectioner's sugar. Dust top of cake with confectioner's sugar and roll up in towel. Let cool completely, about 1 hour, before unrolling and spreading with filling                    </li>
                    <li>Step 4
                        Scrape batter into prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake cake until golden and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 30–35 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan 30 minutes. Invert cake onto rack and unmold; carefully remove parchment paper. Let cool completely.</li>
                    <li>Step 5
                        While the cake is cooling, using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat 2 oz. cream cheese, room temperature, and ¾ cup (1½ sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Stop mixer and add 1 cup (110 g) powdered sugar, sifted, 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, 1 tsp. fresh lemon juice, and 1 tsp. vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract. Beat on low speed until incorporated, about 1 minute. Beat in remaining 1 cup (110 g) powdered sugar, sifted, until incorporated and frosting is lump-free, about 1 minute.</li>
                    <li> Step 6
                        Place cake, right side up, on a cake stand or large plate. Mound frosting on top and spread over surface, leaving a ½" border around the edges. Using an offset spatula or a large spoon, make decorative swirls, swoops, and divots in frosting if desired. Top with sprinkles (if using).</li>
